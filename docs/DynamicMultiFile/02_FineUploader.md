> This is the default adapter. If you want do use this adapter, you only need to enable the [core extension (Section "Enable Extension")](../91_Javascript.md#core-extension) and include the styling resources.
 
Resource: 

- Resource: https://fineuploader.com
- Handler: `jquery.fb.dmf.fine-uploader.js`
- Library: [fine-uploader.min.js](https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/file-uploader/5.16.2/fine-uploader.min.js)

## Implementation

#### Declarative Way
The simplest way to implement this adapter is by using the precompiled library loading by CDN and the corresponding handler.

```twig
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/dropzone/5.9.2/dropzone.min.css" />
<script type="text/javascript" src="{{ asset('bundles/formbuilder/js/frontend/plugins/jquery.fb.core.form-builder.js') }}"></script>
```

```javascript
$(function () {
    $('form.formbuilder.ajax-form').formBuilderAjaxManager({
        dynamicMultiFileHandlerOptions: {
            libPath: 'https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/file-uploader/5.16.2/fine-uploader.min.js'
        }
    });
});
```

#### Imperative Way
This requires more work from your side since we only provide a simple jQuery Handler.
Read more about the implementation [here](https://docs.fineuploader.com/features/modules.html). 
You also need to build your own handler and requires to **[disable the default behaviour](../80_FileUpload.md#disable-default-initialization)**.
