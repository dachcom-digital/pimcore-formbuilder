The Container Type allows you to create field collection. 
There is also a [jQuery Repeater Extension](./91_Javascript.md#repeater-plugin) to create repeatable fields in frontend.

## Repeater

| Label | Define a label (translated in frontend) |
| Block Label | Define a label for each repeated block (translated in frontend) |
| Add Block Counter | Every new added block should have an incrementing counter after the block label |
| Minimum | Define a minimum of pre-rendered blocks |
| Maximum | Define a maximum of addable blocks |
